0.  Longest word in the english language and the limit size of a single word in our dictionary.

1.  The function returns usage statistics for a called process.

2.  16 variables.

3.  To be able to use these same structs again and again withought the need to create new ones.

4.  First of, a pointer pointing to the first character of a text is created. 
    The loop then iterates
 over each character cheking if it is indeed a character (or '), not a number, other object or EOF.
 
    If it is a valid character it is appended to the currect word. If current word is longer than the
 
    maximum length specified (45 chars) or contains numeric characters, this word is ignored and not spellchecked.
 
    If '\0' is encountered, the word is finished and is spellchecked. The process repeats by forming a new
 
    word and then spellcheking it.

5.  The program would not check if it is a valid word (i.e. not containing any digits or other weird chars).
6.  TODO
